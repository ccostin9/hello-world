capstone
I'm almost 40, living in Texas, and pretty obviously doing a capstone. 
I'm more interested in manufacturing innovation at a large scale, than say, Russian information operations. I tried to talk about all of this, but coffee, tacos, â€¦ seem to have a place. I compare it to being abducted, and enjoying to the point of singular focus. It literally is the thrill of my life to know 4.5 billion years of history built this.
